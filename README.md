#This is a place where I can share some of the coding connundrums I face.

I often create mini-sandbox projects locally to help me explore, experiment and better understand various coding challenges. Some of these come from external sources. I've decided it's sometimes worth sharing publicly some of these mini-projects, particularly as others know more than I do and may help me to find better solutions than I'd achieve alone.
